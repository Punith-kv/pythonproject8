of Himalayas, these soils experience
denudation and are acidic with low humus
content. The soils found in the lower parts
of the valleys particularly on the river terraces
and alluvial fans are fertile.

Soil Erosion and Soil Conservation
The denudation of the soil cover and
subsequent washing down is described as soil
erosion. The processes of soil formation and
erosion, go on simultaneously and generally
there is a balance between the two. Sometimes,
this balance is disturbed due to human
activities like deforestation, over-grazing,
construction and mining etc., while natural                        Fig. 1.11: Gully Erosion

soil erosion. The running water cuts through

                                                       into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow

  • The village of Sukhomajri and the district of Jhabua have shown that it is possible to reverse land
    degradation. Tree density in Sukhomajri increased from 13 per hectare in 1976 to 1,272 per
    hectare in 1992;
  • Regeneration of the environment leads to economic well-being, as a result of greater resource
    availability, improved agriculture and animal care, and consequently, increased incomes.
    Average annual household income in Sukhomajri ranged from Rs 10,000-15,000 between
    1979 and 1984;
