In everyday life, we often sped     ll  ions of objects of a particular kind, such as, a pack of 
cards, a crowd      a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come across collections, for exam  
   atural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More spa             llo ing collections:

the sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a given 
collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to the collection of 
rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this colleciton.
We give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz. N : the set of all 
natural numbers
Z : the set of all integers
Q : the set of all rational numbers R : the set of real numbers
Z+ : the set of positive integers
Q’ : the set of positive rational numbers, and R+ : the set of positive real numbers.

Again the collection of five most  no      emati  n    e  or d is not well-defined, because the 
criterion f   et   ini  a mathemati   as  ost renowned may vary from person to person.   s,  s n   
well-define   1   n.
We shall say that a set is  well-de   d collection  ob  ts.
The following points  y  note
(i)  Objects, ele      members of a  t     nymous terms.
(ii)  Sets are usua   e    by capital  t    ,  C, X, Y, Z, etc.
(iii)  The elements o   et are repr  nt    mall letters o, b, c, x, y, z, etc. If o is    m  t of a 
set A, we say th  “ a belongs to A” the Greek symbol e (epsilon) is    to   ote the phr    elongs 
to’. Thus, we write a e A. If ‘b’ is not
an element o     , we write b   a  read “b does not belong to A”.
Thus, in the set V  v    i    nglish alphabet, a e V but b z V. In the set P of prime factors of 
30, 3   b  15 f P.
There are two methods of rep  nting a set :
(i) Roster  ta  ar form
(ii) S   i1  fo
(i)  In roster fo   lthe elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated b  ommas 
and are enclosed within braces (  }. For example, the set of all even i    tegers less than 7 is 
described in roster form as (2, 4, 6}. Some more
ex  ples of representing a set in roster form are given below :
The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is ( 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}.

SETS  3


      In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial. Thus, the above set 
can also be represented as ( 1, 3, 7, 21, 2, 6, 14, 42).
(b)  The set of all vowels in the English alphabet is (a, e, i, o, u] .
(c)  The set of odd natural numbers is represented by ( 1, 3, 5, . .}. The dots tell us that the 
list of odd numbers continue indefinitely.
It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not generally repeated, 
i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set of letters forming the word 
‘SCHOOL’ is ( S, C, H, O, L} or (H, O, L, C, S}. Here, the order of listin elements has no 
relevance.
(ii)  In set-builder form, all the elements of a set po sess a single common pr  rty which is not 
possessed by any element out   the set. For example,  the (a, e, i, o, u}, all the elements possess 
a c  m   roperty, na eJ  a   t  m
is a vowel in the English alphabet, and     letter  ssess this p  e     ting this set by V, we 
write
v = (x : x is a vowel in Englis  ph  et
It may be observed that we   c   the  ement of the  t    ng a symbol x (any other symbol like the 
lette  y, z, etc.   d be used)  ‘ch i  llowed by a colon “ : “. After the sign of col  ,   write  e 
characte       ty possessed by the elements of the set and hen   1    e whole des   tio   ithin 
braces. The above description of the set        ‘the set of a1    h   x is a vowel of the English 
alphabet”. In this descripti   he braces sta    ‘t  set f all”, the colon stands for “such that”. F 
    pie, the set
A = (x   s a n  ural number and 3 < x  0} is read as “the set of all x such that x is a n      ber 
and x  s  ween 3 and 10.” Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and    the elements   e  t A.
If we denote the se   scr   in (a), {b) and (c) above in roster form by A, B, C, respectively, then 
A, B,     o be represented in set-builder form as follows:
A= (x : x is a n  ra1 num er which divides 42} B= (y : y is a ow  ‘n the English alphabet} C= (z :

Writ   solution set of the equation x2 + x — 2 = 0 in roster form.

Consi   e set
: x is a student of Class XI presently studying in a school }
an go to the school and count the number of students presently studying in n the school. Thus, the 
set A contains a finite number of elements.
We now write another set B as follows:



2021-22


6   MATHEMATICS

B = { x : x is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI }
We observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI. Thus, the set B 
contains no element at all.
Definition 1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the
null set or the void set.
According to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The empty set is 
denoted by the symbol φ or { }.
We give below a few examples of empty sets.
(i)  Let A = {x : 1 < x < 2, x is a natural number}. Then A is the empty set, because there is no 
natural number between 1 and 2.
(ii) B = {x : x² – 2 = 0 and x is rational number}. Then B is the empty set because the equation x² 
– 2 = 0 is not satisfied by any rational value of x.
(iii)  C = {x : x is an even prime number greater than 2}.Then C is the empty set, because 2 is the 
only even prime number.
(iv)  D = { x : x² = 4, x is odd }. Then D is the empty set, because the equation
x² = 4 is not satisfied by any odd value of x.
1.4 Finite and Infinite Sets
Let   A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},    B = {a, b, c, d, e, g}
and   C = { men living presently in different parts of the world}
We observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements does C contain? 
As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some natural number which may be 
quite a big number. By number of elements of a set S, we mean the number of distinct elements of 
the set and we denote it by n (S). If n (S) is a natural number, then S is non-empty finite set.
Consider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this set is not finite 
since there are infinite number of natural numbers. We say that the set of natural numbers is an 
infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets and n(A) = 5, n(B) = 6 and n(C) = 
some finite number.
Definition 2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite 
otherwise, the set is called infinite.
Consider some examples :
(i) Let W be the set of the days of the week. Then W is finite.
(ii) Let S be the set of solutions of the equation x² –16 = 0. Then S is finite.
(iii) Let G be the set of points on a line. Then G is infinite.
When we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set within braces {  
}. It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within braces { } because the 
numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent

SETS  7

some infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the structure 
of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots.
For example, {1, 2, 3 . . .} is the set of natural numbers, {1, 3, 5, 7, . . .} is the set of odd 
natural numbers, {. . .,–3, –2, –1, 0,1, 2 ,3, . . .} is the set of integers. All these sets are 
infinite.
🖛Note All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the set of real 
numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this
set do not follow any particular pattern.
Example 6 State which of the following sets are finite or infinite : (i)  {x : x ∈ N and (x 
– 1) (x –2) = 0}
(ii)  {x : x ∈ N and x ² = 4}
(iii)  {x : x ∈ N and 2x –1 = 0}
(iv)  {x : x ∈ N and x is prime}
(v)  {x : x ∈ N and x is odd}
Solution  (i)  Given set = {1, 2}. Hence, it is finite.
(ii)  Given set = {2}. Hence, it is finite.
(iii)  Given set = φ. Hence, it is finite.
(iv)  The given set is the set of all prime numbers and since set of prime numbers is infinite. 
Hence the given set is infinite
(v)  Since there are infinite number of odd numbers, hence, the given set is infinite.
1.5 Equal Sets
Given two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every element of B is 
also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal. Clearly, the two sets have 
exactly the same elements.
Definition 3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements and we 
write A = B. Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write A ≠ B.
We consider the following examples :
(i)  Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and    B = {3, 1, 4, 2}. Then A = B.
(ii)  Let A be the set of prime numbers less than 6 and P the set of prime factors of 30. Then A 
and P are equal, since 2, 3 and 5 are the only prime factors of 30 and also these are less than 6.
🖛Note A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated. For 
example, the sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 2, 1, 3, 3} are equal, since each

8   MATHEMATICS

element of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any
       element     in    describing     a    set.                      
Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons: A = (0),          B = (x : x > 15 and x < 5},
C = (x : x — 5 = 0 },    D = (x: x² = 25 ),
E = (x : x is an integral positive root of the equation x’ — 2x —15 = 0}.
Since 0 e A and 0 does not belong to any of the sets B, C, D and E, it follows that, A  B, A  C, A  
D, A  E.
Since B = Q but none of the other sets are empty. Therefore B  C, B  D and B  E. Also C = (5} but 
—5 e D, hence C  D.
Since E = ( 5}, C = E. Further, D = (—5, 5} a  E = ( 5}, we find that,   E. Thus, the only pair of 
equal sets is C and E.

6.  From the sets given below, select equal sets :
A = { 2, 4, 8, 12}, B = { 1, 2, 3, 4},  C = { 4, 8, 12, 14},  D = { 3, 1, 4, 2}
E = {–1, 1},    F = { 0, a},     G = {1, –1},      H = { 0, 1}
1.6 Subsets
Consider the sets : X = set of all students in your school, Y = set of all students in your class.
We note that every element of Y is also an element of X; we say that Y is a subset of X. The fact 
that Y is subset of X is expressed in symbols as Y ⊂ X. The symbol ⊂ stands for ‘is a subset 
of’ or ‘is contained in’.
Definition 4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of 
B.
In other words, A ⊂ B if whenever a ∈ A, then a ∈ B. It is often convenient 
to use the symbol “⇒” which means implies. Using this symbol, we can write the definiton
of subset as follows:
A ⊂ B if a ∈ A ⇒ a ∈ B
We read the above statement as “A is a subset of B if a is an element of A implies that a is also 
an element of B”. If A is not a subset of B, we write A ⊄ B.
We may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every element of A is in B. 
It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If it so happens that every element 
of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊂ A. In this case, A and B are the same sets 
so that we have A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A ⇔ A = B, where “⇔” is a symbol 
for two way implications, and is usually read as if and only if (briefly written as “iff”).
It follows from the above definition that every set A is a subset of itself, i.e., A ⊂ A. Since the 
empty set φ has no elements, we agree to say that φ is a subset of every set. We 
now consider some examples :

(i) The set Q of rational numbers is a subset of the set R of real numbes, and we write Q  R.
(ii) If A is the set of all divisors of 56 and B the set of all prime divisors of 56, then B is a 
subset of A and we write B  A.
(iii) Let A = ( 1, 3, 5} and B = (x . x is an odd natural number less than 6}. Then A  B and B  A 
and hence A = B.
(iv) Let A = ( o, e, i, o, u] and B = ( o, b, c, d). Then A is not a subset of B, also B is not a 
subset of A.
Let A and B be two sets. If A  B and A r B , then A is called a proper subset
ofB and B is called superset of A. For example,
A = ( 1, 2, 3} is a proper subset of B = ( 1, 2, 3, 4}.
If a set A has only one element, we call it  singleton set. Thus,( a    a singleton set.

The number (b — a) is called the length of any of the intervals (a, b), [a, b], [a, b) or (a, b].

Consider the set ( 1, 2}. Let us write down all the subsets of the set ( 1, 2}. We know that $ is a 
subset of every set . So, $ is a subset of ( 1, 2}. We see that ( 1} and ( 2 }are also subsets of ( 
1, 2}. Also, we know that every set is a subset of itself. So, ( 1, 2 } is a subset of ( 1, 2}. 
Thus, the set ( 1, 2 } has, in all, four subsets, viz. $, ( 1 }, ( 2 } and ( 1, 2 }. The set of all 
these subsets is called the power set of ( 1, 2 } .
The collection of all subsets of a set A is called the power set o
denoted by P(A). In P(A), every element is a set. Thus, as in above, if A = ( 1, 2 }, then
P( A ) = ( p,( 1 },   }, (   }}
Also, note that n [ P (A) ] = 4 = 2²

In general, if A  is a set wi  n(   = m, then n [ P(A)] = 2".

Thus, we can define the union of two sets as follows:
The union of two sets A and B is the set C which consists of all those elements which are either in 
A or in B (including
those which are in both). In symbols, we write. A  B = ( x : x e A or x e B }
The union of two sets can be represented by a   A Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.4.

If A and B are two sets such that A m B = $, then A and B are called disjoint sets.
For example, let A= ( 2, 4, 6, 8 } and
B = ( 1, 3, 5, 7 }. Then A and B are disjoint sets, because there are no elements which are common 
to A and B. The disjoint sets can be represented by means of Venn diagram as shown in the Fig 1.6

1.10.3 Difference of sets The difference of the sets A and B in this order is the set of elements 
which belong to A but not to B. Symbolically, we write A — B and read as “ A minus B”.
Example 18 Let A = ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), B = ( 2, 4, 6, 8 }. Find A — B and B — A.
We have, A — B = ( 1, 3, 5 }, since the elements 1, 3, 5 belong to A but not to B and B — A = ( 8 
), since the element 8 belongs to B and not to A.
We note that A — B  B — A.
Let V = ( a, e, i, o, u j and B = ( a, i, k, u]. Find V  B and B
We have, V— B = ( e, o ], since the elements e, o belong to V but not to B and B — V = ( k \, sinc 
the element k belongs to B but not to V.
We note that V  B z B  V. Using builder notation, we can rewrite the defi difference as
B = ( x : x e A and x I

1.11 Complement of a Set
Let U be the universal set which consists of all prime numbers and A be the subset of U which 
consists of all those prime numbers that are not divisors of 42. Thus, A = {x : x ∈ U and 
x is not a divisor of 42 }. We see that 2 ∈ U but 2 ∉ A, because 2 is divisor of 
42. Similarly, 3 ∈ U but 3 ∉ A, and 7 ∈ U but 7 ∉ A. Now 2, 3 
and 7 are the only elements of U which do not belong to A. The set of these three prime numbers, 
i.e., the set {2, 3, 7} is called the Complement of A with respect to U, and is denoted by

A’  (x : x e U and x z A }. This leads to the following definition.
Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements 
of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we write A’ to denote the complement of A with 
respect to U. Thus,
A’ = (x : x e U and x z A }. Obviously A’ = U — A
We note that the complement of a set A can be looked upon, alternatively, as the difference between 
a universal set U and the set A.
Let U = ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and A = ( 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Find A’.
We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not b

A’ = ( 2, 4, 6, 8,10 ).
Let U be universal set of all the st    of Class XI of Joe      a

Given that                  U
n ( X  Y ) = 50, n ( X ) = 28, n ( Y ) = 32,
n (X  Y) = ?
By using the formula
n ( X  Y ) = n ( X ) + n ( Y ) — n ( X  Y ),
we find that
n ( X  Y ) = n ( X ) + n (  ) —  ( X  Y )
= 28 + 32 — 50 = 10
Alternatively, suppose n ( X  Y ) = k, then




—v  Y-X


Fig 1.12
n ( X — Y ) = 28 — k , n ( Y — X ) = 32 — k (by Venn diagram in Fig 1. 2 ) This gives 50 = n ( X  Y 
) = n (X — Y) + n (   Y) + n ( Y — X)
= ( 28 — k ) + k + (32 — k )

Hence
k —— 10.                        I

In a survey of 400 students in a school, 100 were listed as taking apple

Find how many students were taking neither apple juice nor orange juice.
Let U denote the set of surveyed students and A denote the set of students taking apple juice and B 
denote the set of students taking orange juice. Then
n (U) = 400, n (A) = 100, n (B) = 150 and n (A  B) = 75.
Now  n (A’ m B’) = n (A  B)’

Summary
This chapter deals with some basic definitions and operations involving sets. These are summarised 
below:
⬥A set is a well-defined collection of objects.
⬥A set which does not contain any element is called empty set.
⬥A set which consists of a definite number of elements is called finite set, 
otherwise, the set is called infinite set.
⬥Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements.
⬥A set A is said to be subset of a set B, if every element of A is also an element of 
B. Intervals are subsets of R.
⬥A power set of a set A is collection of all subsets of A. It is denoted by P(A).

⬥The union of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which are either in A 
or in B.
⬥The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are common. 
The difference of two sets A and B in this order is the set of elements which belong to A but not 
to B.
⬥The complement of a subset A of universal set U is the set of all elements of U which are not the 
elements of A.
⬥For any two sets A and B, (A ∪ B)′ = A′ ∩ 
B′ and ( A ∩ B )′ = A′ ∪ B′
⬥If A and B are finite sets such that A ∩ B = φ, then
n (A ∪ B) = n (A) + n (B).
If A ∩ B ≠ φ, then
n (A ∪ B) = n (A) + n (B) – n (A ∩ B)



Historical Note
The modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the German mathematician 
Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His 
study of set theory came when he
was studying trigonometric series of the form a1 sin x + a2 sin 2x + a3 sin 3x + ... He published 
in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into
one-to-one correspondence wih the integers. From 1879 onwards, he publishd several papers showing 
various properties of abstract sets.
Cantor’s work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). But 
Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding infinite set the same way as finite sets. 
Another German mathematician Gottlob Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as 
principles of logic. Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence 
of the set of all sets. It was the famous Englih Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872- 1970 ) who 
showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This 
led to the famous Russell’s Paradox. Paul R.Halmos writes about it in his book ‘Naïve Set Theory’ 
that “nothing contains everything”. The Russell’s Paradox was not the only one which arose in set 
theory.
Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians.

SETS  29


As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory was published in 
1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922. John Von Neumann in 
1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more 
satisfactory axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Godel in his monograph 
in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Godel- Bernays (GB) set theory.
Despite all these difficulties, Cantor's set theory is used in pres mathematics. In fact, these 
days most of the concepts and results in math are expressed in the set theoretic language.
