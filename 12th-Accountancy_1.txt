which function without  any profit motive. Their  main aim is to provide service to a
specific group or the public at large. Normally, they do not manufacture, purchase or
sell goods and may not  have credit transactions.  Hence they need not  maintain
many books of account (as the trading concerns do) and Trading and Profit and Loss
Account. The funds  raised by such  organisations are credited to capital  fund  or
general fund. The major sources of their income usually are subscriptions from their
members donations, grants-in-aid, income from investments, etc. The main objective
of keeping records in such organisations is to meet the statutory requirement and
help them in exercising control over utilisation of their funds. They also have to prepare
the financial statements at the  end of each accounting period (usually a financial
year) and ascertain their income and  expenditure and the financial  position, and
submit them to the statutory authority called Registrar of Societies.

The main characteristics  of such organisations  are:

      1. Such   organisations are formed for providing service to a specific group or
           public  at large such as education, health care, recreation, sports and so on
           without  any consideration of caste, creed and colour. Its sole aim is to provide
           service either free of cost or at nominal cost, and not to earn profit.
      2. These  are  organised as  charitable  trusts/societies    and  subscribers  to
           such  organisation  are called members.
      3. Their   affairs  are usually  managed by a managing/executive   committee
           elected by its members.
      4. The  main  sources of income of such organisations   are: (i) subscriptions
           from  members, (ii)  donations  (general). (iii) legacies(general). (iv) grant-
           in-aid,  (v) income from investments,  etc.
      5. The   funds  raised  by such  organisations   through   various  sources  are
           credited  to capital  fund  or general fund.
      6. The  surplus  generated  in the form  of excess of income over expenditure
           is  not  distributed    amongst   the  members.  It  is  simply   added  in  the
           capital  fund.
      7. The  Not-for-Profit    Organisations  earn  their  reputation   on the  basis of
           their   contributions    to  the  welfare  of  the  society  rather   than  on  the
           customers’  or owners’ satisfaction.
      8. The  accounting  information  provided by such  organisations is  meant for
           the present and potential contributors and to meet the statutory requirement.

1.2 Accounting     Records  of Not-for-Profit     Organisations

As stated earlier, normally  such organisations  are not engaged in any trading or
business activities.   The main  sources  of their  income are  subscriptions   from
members, donations,   financial  assistance  from government   and income  from
investments.  Most of their transactions   are in cash or through  the bank.  These

institutions   are  required  by law  to keep proper  accounting   records and  keep
proper control  over the utilization   of their  funds. This  is why they usually  keep
a cash book in  which  all  receipts and  payments  are duly  recorded.  They also
maintain   a ledger  containing   the accounts   of all  incomes,  expenses,  assets
and liabilities   which  facilitates  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  at  the
end of the accounting period.  In addition,  they are required  to maintain  a stock
register to  keep complete  record of  all fixed  assets and  the consumables.
     They  do not  maintain   any capital  account.   Instead  they maintain   capital
fund  which   is  also  called  general  fund  that   goes on  accumulating    due  to
surpluses  generated, life  membership  fee, etc.,  received from  year to  year. In
fact, a proper system of accounting is desirable to avoid or minimise the chances
of misappropriations  or embezzlement of the funds contributed  by the members
and other donors.

Final Accounts or Financial Statements: The Not-for-Profit Organisations are also
required to prepare financial statements at the end of the each accounting period.
Although these organisations are non-profit making entities and they are not required
to make Trading and Profit & Loss Account but it is necessary to know whether the
income during the year was sufficient  to meet the expenses or not. Not only that
they have to provide the necessary financial information to members, donors, and
contributors  and also to the Registrar of Societies. For this purpose, they have to
prepare their final  accounts at the  end of the accounting  period and the  general
principles of accounting are fully  applicable in their  preparation as stated earlier,
the final accounts of a ‘not-for-profit  organisation’ consist of the following:
      (i) Receipt  and  Payment Account
     (ii) Income   and Expenditure   Account, and
    (iii) Balance   Sheet.
     The  Receipt  and  Payment   Account  is  the   summary   of  cash  and  bank
transactions which  helps in the preparation  of Income and Expenditure Account
and the Balance  Sheet. Besides,  it is  a legal requirement   as the Receipts and
Payments Account  has also to be submitted  to  the Registrar  of Societies along
with the  Income and  Expenditure  Account,  and  the Balance  Sheet.
     Income  and  Expenditure  Account  is  akin  to Profit  and Loss  Account.  The
Not-for-Profit   Organisations    usually   prepare  the  Income   and  Expenditure
Account and  a Balance  Sheet with  the help  of Receipt and  Payment Account.
However, this does not imply  that  they do not  make a trial  balance.  In order to
check the  accuracy  of the  ledger accounts,   they also  prepare  a trial  balance
which facilitates   the preparation  of accurate  Receipt and Payment  Account  as
well as the  Income and  Expenditure  Account  and  the Balance  Sheet.
     In  fact, if  an organisation   has followed the  double entry  system  they must
prepare a trial  balance for  checking the  accuracy of the ledger  accounts and  it
will  also facilitate   the  preparation   of Receipt  and  Payment account.   Income
and Expenditure   Account  and the  Balance Sheet.

1.3 Receipt    and  Payment   Account
It is prepared at the end of the accounting  year on the basis of cash receipts and
cash payments  recorded in  the cash  book. It  is a  summary  of cash and  bank
transactions under  various heads. For example, subscriptions  received from the
members on different dates which appear on the debit side of the cash book, shall
be shown on the receipts  side of the Receipt and Payment Account  as one item
with its total amount.  Similarly,  salary, rent, electricity  charges paid from time to
time as recorded on the credit side of the cash book but the total salary paid, total
rent paid,  total electricity  charges paid  during  the year appear on  the payment
side  of the Receipt and Payment Account. Thus,  Receipt and Payment Account
gives summarised picture of various receipts and payments, irrespective of whether
they pertain to the current period, previous period or succeeding period or whether
they are of capital or revenue nature.  It may be noted that this  account does not
show any non cash  item like  depreciation. The opening  balance in  Receipt and
Payment Account represents  cash in hand/cash   at bank  which is shown  on its
receipts side and the closing balance of this account represents cash in hand and
bank balance  as at the  end of the  year, which appear  on the  credit side  of the
Receipt and Payment Account. However, if it is bank overdraft  at the end it shall
be shown on its debit side as the last item. Let us look at the cash book of Golden
Cricket Club  given in the example to show how  the total amount  of each item of
receipt and payment has been worked  out.

Similarly, the payments side of the Receipts and Payments Account lists the Revenue
Payments (for past, current and future periods) as well as Capital Payments.

1.3.1  Salient  Features

      1. It   is a summary of the cash book. Its  form is identical  with  that of simple
           cash  book (without   discount  and bank  columns)  with  debit  and credit
           sides. Receipts are recorded on the debit side while payments are entered
           on the credit  side.
      2. It   shows the  total amounts   of all receipts  and payments  irrespective  of
           the period to which they pertain . For example, in the Receipt and Payment
           account   for the  year  ending  on  March  31,  2016,  we record  the  total
           subscriptions   received  during  2015–16 including   the  amounts  related
           to  the  years 2014–2015  and  2016-2017.   Similarly,  taxes  paid  during
           2015–16  even if they  relate to the  years 2014–15  and 2016–2017.
      3. It   includes all  receipts and payments  whether  they are of capital  nature
           or of revenue nature.
      4. No  distinction   is  made in  receipts/payments   made in  cash or  through
           bank.  With  the exception of the  opening and closing  balances, the  total
           amount  of each receipt and  payment is shown  in this  account.
      5. No  non-cash  items such  as depreciation outstanding   expenses accrued
           income,  etc. are shown in this  account.
      6. It   begins  with  opening  balance  of cash in  hand  and  cash  at bank  (or
           bank  overdraft)  and closes with  the  year end balance  of cash in hand/
           cash  at  bank  or  bank   overdraft.  In  fact,  the  closing  balance   in  this
           account  (difference between the total  amount  of receipts and payments)
           which  is usually  a debit balance  reflects cash in hand  and cash at bank
           unless  there is a bank  overdraft.

1.3.2    Steps in   the  Preparation    of  Receipt  and  Payment   Account

      1. Take  the  opening balances of cash  in hand  and cash at bank  and enter
           them  on the debit side. In  case there is bank overdraft  at the begining  of
           the year, enter  the same on the credit  side of this account.
      2. Show   the total  amounts   of all receipts  on  its debit  side  irrespective  of
           their  nature   (whether  capital  or revenue)  and whether  they  pertain  to
           past,  current  and future  periods.
      3. Show  the  total amounts  of all payments  on its credit  side irrespective  of
           their  nature   (whether  capital  or revenue)  and whether  they  pertain  to
           past,  current  and future  periods.
      4. None  of the  receivable income  and payable  expense is to  be entered in
           this  account  as they do not involve  inflow or outflow  of cash.
      5. Find   out  the difference  between  the total  of debit  side and  the  total  of
           credit  side of  the account  and enter  the same  on the credit  side as the
           closing  balance  of cash/bank.   In  case, however, the  total  of the credit
           side is more than that  of the total of the debit side, show the difference on
           the  debit as bank overdraft  and  close the account.

book given in example 1, at page 4, the Receipt and Payment Account of  Golden

1.4   Income  and  Expenditure    Account

It is the summary  of income  and expenditure  for  the accounting  year. It is  just
like a profit  and loss account prepared  on accrual  basis in case of the business
organisations.   It  includes   only  revenue   items  and  the  balance  at  the  end
represents  surplus  or  deficit.    The Income  and  Expenditure   Account  serves
the same purpose   as the profit   and loss  account  of a  business  organisation
does. All  the revenue  items  relating   to the  current   period  are shown  in  this
account,  the expenses  and losses  on the  expenditure   side and  incomes  and
gains on the  income  side of the account.   It shows  the net  operating  result  in
the form of surplus  (i.e. excess of income over expenditure) or deficit (i.e. excess
of expenditure  over income), which  is transferred  to  the capital  fund  shown in
the balance sheet.
     The Income and  Expenditure  Account is prepared  on accrual basis with  the
help  of Receipts  and  Payments  Account   along  with   additional   information
regarding outstanding  and prepaid expenses and depreciation etc. Hence, many
items appearing in the Receipts and Payments need to be adjusted. For example,
as shown in Example 1, (Page No. 10) subscription amount of Rs.2, 65,000 received
during the year 2014-15 appearing on the receipts side of the Receipt and Payment

1.4.1  Steps  in  the  Preparation     of Income   and  Expenditure    Account

Following steps may be helpful in preparing an Income and Expenditure Account
from a given Receipt and Payment  Account:
      1. Persue  the Receipt  and Payment Account  thoroughly.
      2. Exclude   the  opening  and  closing  balances  of cash  and  bank  as they
           are not  an income.
      3. Exclude   the  capital  receipts  and  capital  payments   as these are  to  be
           shown  in  the Balance Sheet.
      4. Consider   only  the revenue  receipts  to be shown  on the  income side  of
           Income and  Expenditure  Account.  Some of these need to be adjusted by
           excluding   the  amounts  relating   to the  preceding  and  the  succeeding
           periods  and including   the amounts  relating   to the current   year not yet
           received.
      5. Take   the revenue  expenses to the  expenditure  side  of the Income  and
           Expenditure    Account   with   due  adjustments    as  per  the   additional
           information   provided  relating  to  the amounts  received  in advance and
           those  not  yet received.
      6. Consider   the following  items not  appearing in  the Receipt and Payment
           Account  that need to be taken into account  for determining  the surplus/
           deficit  for the current   year :
           (a) Depreciation   of fixed assets.
           (b) Provision  for  doubtful  debts, if  required.
           (c) Profit  or  loss on sale of fixed assets.

Now you  will  observe how  the  income  and expenditure   account  is  prepared
from the receipts  and payments  account  given in example 1,  on page 10.

1.5  Balance  Sheet

‘Not-for-Profit’ Organisations prepare Balance Sheet for ascertaining the financial
position of the organisation. The preparation of their Balance Sheet is on the same
pattern as that of the business entities. It shows assets and liabilities as at the end
of the year. Assets are shown on the right hand side and the liabilities  on the left
hand side. However, there will be a Capital Fund or General Fund in  place of the
Capital and the surplus  or deficit as per Income and Expenditure Account  which
is either added to/deducted   from the capital  fund,  as the case may be. It is also
a common practice  to add some of the capitalised  items  like legacies, entrance
fees and life membership fees directly  in the capital  fund.
     Besides the  Capital  or General Fund,  there may  be other funds  created for
specific purposes or to meet the requirements   of the contributors/donors    such
as building   fund,  sports  fund,   etc. Such  funds  are  shown  separately  in  the
liabilities  side of the balance sheet.
     Some times it becomes necessary to prepare Balance Sheet as at the beginning
of the year in order to find  out the opening balance of the capital/general   fund.

1.5.1 Preparation       of  Balance   Sheet

The following procedure  is  adopted to prepare  the  Balance  Sheet:
      1. Take   the Capital/General    Fund  as per the  opening balance  sheet and
           add  surplus  from  the  Income and  Expenditure   Account.  Further,  add
           entrance fees, legacies, life membership fees, etc. received during the year.
      2. Take   all the  fixed  assets (not  sold/discarded/or    destroyed  during   the
           year)  with  additions   (from  the  Receipts and  Payments  account)  after
           charging depreciation  (as per Income and Expenditure account) and show
           them  on the assets side.
      3. Compare  items on the receipts side of the Receipts and Payments Account
           with   income  side of  the Income  and  Expenditure   Account.  This  is  to
           ascertain   the amounts   of: (a) subscriptions    due but  not  yet  received:
           (b) incomes received in advance;  (c) sale of fixed assets made during the
           year; (d) items to  be capitalised (i.e. taken  directly  to the Balance Sheet)
           e.g. legacies, interest on specific  fund investment  and so on.
      4. Similarly     compare,  items   on the  payments   side  of  the  Receipt  and
           Payment     Account    with    expenditure      side    of  the   Income    and
           Expenditure      Account.    This   is  to   ascertain    the   amounts    if:   (a)
           outstanding    expenses;  (b) prepaid   expenses; (c)  purchase  of  a fixed
           asset  during   the  year;  (d)  depreciation   on  fixed  assets;  (e) stock   of
           consumable   items  like stationery   in  hand;  (f) Closing balance  of cash
           in  hand  and cash  at bank  as,  and so on.
A proforma  Balance Sheet is given  for the proper  understanding    of preparing
the balance  sheet.

1.6 Some   Peculiar   Items

Final accounts  of the  Not-for-Profit   organisations  are prepared  on the  similar
pattern  as that  of a business orgnisation.   However, a few items of income  and
expenses of such orgnisations are somewhat different in nature and need special
attention   in  their   treatment   in  final   accounts.   They  are  peculiar   to  these
orgnisations.  Some of the common peculiar  items are explained  as under:

Subscriptions:   Subscription  is a membership fee paid by the member on annual
basis. This is the main source of income of such orgnisations.  Subscription  paid
by the members is shown as receipt in the Receipt and Payment Account  and as
income in  the Income and  Expenditure  Account.  It  may be noted  that Receipt
and Payment Account shows the total  amount  of subscription  actually  received
during the year while  the amount  shown in Income and Expenditure  Account  is
confined to the  figure related  to the current   period only  irrespective  of the fact
whether it has been received or not.  For example, a club  received Rs. 20,000 as
subscriptions    during   the  year   2016-17   of  which  Rs.3,000   relate   to  year
2015-16 and Rs.2,000  to 2017-18, and at  the end of the year 2016-17 Rs.6,000
are still  receivable.  In this  case,  the Receipt  and Payment  Account  will  show
Rs.20,000  as receipt   from  subscriptions.   But   the  Income  and  Expenditure
Account  will   show  Rs.  21,000   as income   from  subscriptions    for  the  year
2016-17,  the calculation  of which  is given as below:
                                                                                                                 Rs.
                 Subscriptions received in 2016-17                                    20,000
                 Less: Subscriptions for the year 2015-16                            3,000

                 Less: Subscription for the year 2017-18                             2,000
                                                                                                            15,000
                 Add: Subscriptions outstanding for the year 2016-17         6,000
                 Income from subscriptions for the year 2016-17              21,000

specific legacy and  is shown  in the  balance sheet  as liability.   If the use  is not
specified  it  is  considered   as  revenue  nature   and   credited  to  income   and
expenditure  account.

Life Membership Fees: Some members  prefer to pay  lump  sum amount  as  life
membership fee instead of paying periodic subscription.  Such amount is  treated
as capital receipt and  credited directly  to the capital/general  fund.

Entrance Fees: Entrance  fee also known  as admission  fee is paid only once by
the member at the time of becoming a member. In case of organisations like clubs
and some charitable  institutions,   is limited  and  the amount  of entrance fees is
quite high.  Hence, it  is  treated as  non-recurring   item and  credited  directly  to
capital/general  fund.

Sale of old asset: Receipts from  the sale of an old  asset appear in  the Receipts
and Payments Account of the year in which it  is sold. But any gain or loss on the
sale of asset is taken  to the  Income and  Expenditure  Account  of the  year. For
example, if an  item furniture    with  a book value of Rs.  800 is sold  for Rs. 700,
this  amount  of  Rs. 700  will  be  shown  as receipt  in  Receipts  and  Payments
Account and  Rs. 100  on the expenditure   side of the  Income and  Expenditure
Account as a loss on sale of old asset and while showing furniture in  the balance
sheet Rs. 800 will  be deducted from  its total  book value.

Sale of Periodicals: It  is an item  of recurring   nature  and shown  as the income
side of the Income and Expenditure   Account.

Sale of Sports Materials:  Sale of sports materials  (used materials  like old balls,
bats, nets, etc) is the  regular feature  with  any Sports Club.  It is  usually  shown
as an income in the  Income and Expenditure   Account.

Payments of  Honorarium:  It  is the  amount  paid  to the  person  who is  not the
regular employee of the institution.   Payment to an artist  for giving performance

at the club is an example of honorarium.   This payment of honorarium   is shown
on the expenditure  side of the Income  and Expenditure  Account.

Endowment  Fund:  It  is  a fund  arising   from  a bequest  or gift,  the  income  of
which is devoted for a specific purpose.  Hence, it is a capital  receipt and shown
on the Liabilities side of the Balance Sheet as an item of a specific purpose fund.

Government  Grant:   Schools,   colleges,  public   hospitals,   etc.  depend  upon
government  grant   for  their   activities.   The  recurring   grants   in  the  form  of
maintenance grant  is treated as revenue receipt (i.e. income of the current  year)
and credited   to Income  and  Expenditure   account.  However,  grants  such  as
building  grant are treated as capital receipt and  transferred to the building  fund
account.  It may  be noted that   some Not-for-Profit   organisations  receive cash
subsidy  from  the  government  or  government  agencies.  This  subsidy  is  also
treated as revenue income for the  year in which it  is received.

Special Funds

The  Not-for-Profit     Organisations    office   create  special   funds   for   certain
purposes/activities    such  as 'prize funds',  'match  fund'  and  'sports fund',   etc.
Such  funds   are  invested   in   securities    and  the   income  earned   on  such
investments   is  added  to  the  respective   fund,  not   credited  to  Income   and
Expenditure   Account.    Similarly,    the  expenses  incurred    on  such  specific
purposes  are also deducted  from  the  special  fund.  For example,  a club  may
maintain  a special  fund  for sports  activities.   In such  a situation,   the interest
income on sports fund investments  is added to the sports fund  and all expenses
on sports deducted  therefrom.   The special funds  are shown  in balance  sheet.
However, if, after adjustment  of income and  expenses the balance in specific or
special fund  is  negative,  it is  transferred  to  the debit  side  of the Income  and
Expenditure  Account or adjusted  as per prescribed directions. (see Illustrations
8 and 9.)

            investment   income   Rs.6,800  while  Receipts  and  Payments  Account   shows
            the   receipts    of    Rs.6,000   the   difference    of  Rs.800   means   interest    on
            investment   has  become  due but   not  yet  receivable   during   the  year.
       2. Income   and  Expenditure   Account  shows  Rs.90,000  as  income  from  Tuition
            fees.  However,   the  Receipts  and   Payments  Account   shows  Rs.10,000    as
            tuition    fees  received  for  the  year  2017-18   and  Rs.80,000   for  2015-16.   It
            implies   that  Rs.10,000   on account   of tuition   fees  for  the year  2016-17   are
            still   receivable  (i.e.  Tuition   fees  are outstanding).

           of Rs.84,000 on account  of staff salaries. It  means the excess of Rs.1,000
           shown  in  the  Receipt and  Payment  Account  may either  belong  to  the
           pervious year or  the next year. Their   is  no evidence that staff salaries of
           Rs.1,000 was outstanding at the end of the  previous year  2013-14. This is
           why this  payment of Rs.1,000 has been considered  as an advance salaries
           to  the staff.

                                                          Summary

1. Difference   between Profit Seeking Entities  and  Not-for-Profit Entities:  Profit-
     seeking entities  undertake activities  such as manufacturing  trading,  banking
     and insurance to  bring financial gain to the owners. Not-for-Profit entities exist
     to provide services to the member or to the society at large. Such entities might
     sometimes carry on trading activities but the profits  arising therefrom are used
     for  further  the service objectives.
2. Appreciation   of the need for  separate Accounting Treatment for  Not-for-Profit
     Organisations:  Since not-for-profit  entities  are guided  primarily  by a  service
     motive, the decisions made by their managers are different from those made by
     their   counterparts   in  profit-seeking  entities.   Differences  in  the  nature  of
     decisions implies that the  financial information on which  they are based, must
     also be  different in  content and presentation.
3. Explanation  of the nature of the Principal Financial Statements prepare by Not-for-
     Profit  enterprises: Not-for-Profit  Organisations that  maintain  accounts based
     on  the double-entry  system of  accounting, generally prepare  three principal
     statements   to  fulfil   their  information   needs.  These include  Receipts  and
     Payments Account, Income and Expenditure  Account, and a Balance Sheet.
     The  Receipts and Payments Account  is  summarised  under relevant  heads,
     cash  book  which  records   all  cash  Receipts and  cash  Payments  without
     distinguishing  between capital and revenue items, and between items relating
     to  the current  year and those relating to previous or  future years.
     The Income and Expenditure Account is an income statement which is prepared
     to  ascertain  the excess of revenue income over  revenue expenditure or  vice










                                                           2021-22

     versa, for a particular accounting year, as a result of the entity’s overall activities.
     Although it  is considered to be a substitute for the Trading and Profit and Loss
     Account  of  a profit-seeking  entity,  there  are certain  conceptual  differences
     between the two statements. The Balance Sheet is prepared at the end  of the
     entity’s accounting year to depict the financial position on that date. It includes
     the  Capital Fund  or  Accumulated Fund, special  purpose funds, and  current
     liabilities  on the left hand or liabilities side, and fixed assets and current assets
     on  the right  hand or assets side.
4. Difference   between the  Receipt and  Payment Account and  the  Income and
     Expenditure  Account: Many differences exist between the Receipt and Payment
     Account  and the Income and  Expenditure Account which  is evident from  the
     nature  and purpose of  two statements. While the former  records both capital
     and  revenue receipts and payments relating to any accounting year, the latter
     records only  revenue items relating to  the current  accounting year. Non-cash
     expenses such as depreciation on  fixed assets and outstanding  incomes and
     expenses are shown in  the latter  but  omitted in  the former. The Receipt and
     Payment Account has an  opening balance while the Income and  Expenditure
     Account does not.  The closing balance of the former account represents cash
     and  bank balances on the closing date while in  the latter  account it indicates
     surplus  or deficit  from the activities  of the enterprise.
5. Conversion  of a Receipt and Payment Account into an Income and Expenditure
     Account: This  essentially involves five steps namely, (i) adjusting  the revenue
     receipts on the  debit side to include  accrued incomes and incomes relating to
     the  current  year received earlier and to  exclude amounts received in arrears
     or in  advance; (ii) adjusting revenue payments on the credit side; (iii) identifying
     and  showing non-cash expenses and losses on the  debit  side of the  Income
     and  Expenditure  Account;  (iv)  computing  and showing  profits/losses   from
     trading   and/or  social  activities  on the  credit/debit   side of  the  Income and
     Expenditure Account; and  (v) ascertaining the surplus or deficit as the  closing
     balance of the  Income and Expenditure Account.
