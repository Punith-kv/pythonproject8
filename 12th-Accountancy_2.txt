of law,
1 o¥sesses only those properties which the charter bits creation confers upon it, either expressly 
or as incidental to its very existence”.
A company usually raises its capital in the form of shares (called share capital) and debentures 
(debt capital.) This chapter deals with the accounting for share capital of companies.
1.1  Features of a Company
A company may be viewed as an association of person who contribute money or money's worth to a 
common inventory and use it for a common purpose. It is an artificial person having corporate legal 
entity distinct from its members (shareholders) and has a common seal used for its signature. Thus,

it has certain special features which distinguish it from the other forms of organisation. These 
are as follows:
•  Body Corporate: A company is formed according to the provisions of Law enforced from time to 
time. Generally, in India, the companies are formed and registered under Companies Law except in 
the case of Banking and Insurance companies for which a separate Law is provided for.
•  !Separate Lepnl Entity: A company has a separate legal entity which is distinct and separate 
from its members. It can hold and deal with any type of property. It can enter into contracts and 
even open a barik account in its own name.
•  Limited Linbili  : The liability of the members of the company is limited to the extent of 
unpaid amount of the shares held by them. In the case of the companies limited by guarantee, the 
liability of its members is limited to the extent of the guarantee given by them in the event of 
the company being wound up.
•  Perpetual !Successiori: The company being an   icial person created by law continues to exist 
irrespective of the ch    in its membership. A
company can be terminated only   ough     he death or insanity Or
insolvency of any member of the c     y    way affects the existence of the company. Members may co 
   d    t the company continues.
•  Common Set  The company         cial person, cannot sign its name by itself. Therefore, every c  
 an   equired to have its own seal which

acts as official signatur   f the carry the common seal o
mpany. Any document which does not
pany is not binding on the company.
•  TransJernbilitp of!SAares    e shares of a public limited company are freely transferable. The   
  ission of the company or the consent of any member of the com     is not necessary for the 
transfer of shares. But the Articles of the     any can prescribe the manner in which the transfer 
of shares will be made.
•  May !Sue or be Sued: A company being a legal person can enter into contracts and can enforce the 
contractual rights against others. It can sue and be sued in its name if there is a breach of 
contract by the company.
1.2  IEinds of Compazzies
Companies can be classified either on the basis of the liability of its members or on the basis of 
the number of members. On  the basis of liability of its members the companies can be classified 
into the following three categories:
(i)  Companies Limited by !SIiares: In this case, the liability of its members is limited to the 
extent of the nominal value of shares held by them. If a member has paid the full amount of the 
shares, there is no liability on his part whatsoever may be for the debts of the company. He need 
not pay a single paise from his private property. However, if there is



2021-22


Accounting/or Share Capital

any liability involved, it can be enforced during the existence of the company as well as during 
the winding up.
(fi)  Companies Limited by Gunrnntee: In this case, the liability of its members is limited to the 
amount they undertake to contribute in the event of the company being wound up. Thus, the liability 
of the members will arise only in the event of its winding up.
(iii)  Unlimited Companies: When there is no limit on the liability of its members, the company is 
called an unlimited company. When the company's property is not sufficient to pay off its debts, 
the private property of its members can be used for the purpose. In other words, the creditors can 
claim their dues from its members. Such companies are not found in India even though permitted by 
the Companies Act.
On the basis of the number of members, companies can be divided into three categories as follows:
(i)  Public Company: A public company means a company which (a) is not a private company; (b) is a 
company which i  not a subsidiary of a private company.
(ii)  Private Company: A private company is     hich by its articles of association:
(a)   Restricts the right to tr     i   ares;
(b)   A private company m    av    east 2 persons, except in case
of one person com

(c)   Limits the num employees);

(iii)  One Person Company (OP   Sec. 2 (62) of the companies Act, 2013,
defines OPC as a “com    which has only one person as a member”.
Rule 3 of the Comp   e  (Incorporation) Rules, 2014 provides that:
(a)    Only a nat    person being an Indian citizen and resident in
India can  m one person company,
(b)    It cannot carry out non-banking financial investment activities.
(c)   Its paid up share capital is not more than Rs. 50 Lakhs
(d)    Its  average annual turnover of three years does not exceed
Rs. 2 Crores.
1.3   Share Capital of a Company
A company, being an artificial person, cannot generate its own capital which has necessarily to be 
collected from several persons. These persons are known as shareholders and the amount contributed 
by them is called share capital. Since the number of shareholders is very very large, a separate 
capital account cannot be opened for each one of them. Hence, innumerable streams of capital 
contribution merge their identities in a common capital account called as ‘Share Capital Account’.

From accounting point of view the share capital of the company can be classified as follows:
•  Authorised Capital: Authorised capital is the amount of share capital which a company is 
authorised to issue by its Memorandum of Association. The company cannot raise more than the amount 
of capital as specified in the Memorandum of Association. It is also called Nominal or Registered 
capital. The authorised capital can be increased or decreased as per the procedure laid down in the 
Companies Act. It should be noted that the company need not issue the entire authorised capital for 
public subscription at a time. Depending upon its requirement, it may issue share capital but in 
any case, it should not be more than the amount of authorised capital.
•  Issued Capital: It is that part of the authorised capital which is actually issued to the public 
for subscription including the shares allotted to vendors and the signatories to the company's 
memorandum. The authorised capital which is not offered for public subscription is     as ‘unissued 
capital’. Unissued capital may be offered for public subsc   ion at a later date.
•  !Subscribed Capital: It is that part of the iss    apital which has been actually subscribed by 
the public. men  t    ares offered for public subscription are subscribed fully   the  fihlic the 
issued capital and subscribed capital would be thy    e.    ay be noted that ultimately, the 
subscribed capital may beta   or less than issued capital. In case the number of shares such   
isless than what is offered, the company allots only the    b  of shares for which subscription has 
been received. In case it is     r than what is offered, the allotment will be equal to the off  I  
  r words, the fact of over subscription is not reflected in the books
•  Called up Capital: It is t   part of the subscribed capital which has been
called up on the shar    . ., what the company has asked the shareholders to pay. The company   ay 
decide to call the entire amount or part of the face value of the shares, For example, if the face 
value (also called nominal value) of a share allotted is Rs. 10 and the company has called up only 
Rs. 7 per share, in that scenario, the called up capital is Rs. 7 per share. The remaining Rs. 3 
may be collected from its shareholders as and when needed.
•  Paici up Capital: It is that portion of the called up capital which has been actually received 
from the shareholders. When the shareholders have paid all the called amount, the called up capital 
is the same to the paid up capital. If any of the shareholders has not paid amount on calls, such 
an amount may be called as ‘calls in arrears’. Therefore, paid up capital is equal to the called-up 
capital minus call in arrears.
•  Uncnlled Capital: That portion of the subscribed capital which has not yet been called up. As 
stated earlier, the company may collect this amount any time when it needs further funds.

•  Re:serue Capital: A company may reserve a portion of its uncalled capital to be called only in 
the event of winding up of the company. Such uncalled amount is called ‘Reserve Capital’ of the 
company. It is available only for the creditors on winding up of the company.

1.4  Nature azzd Classes oC Shazes
Shares, refer to the units into which the total share capital of a company is divided. Thus, a 
share is a fractional part of the share capital and forms the basis of ownership interest in a 
company. The persons who contribute money through shares are called shareholders.
The amount of authorised capital, together with the number of shares in which it is divided, is 
stated in the Memorandum of Association but the classes of shares in which the company's capital is 
to be divided, along with their respective rights and obligations, are prescribed by the Articles 
of Association of the company. As per The Companies Act, a company can issue two types of shares 
(1) preference shares, and (2) equity shares (also called ordinary shares).

f.4.f Pre/erence Shares
According to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 2013, reference share is one,
which fulfils the following conditions :
(a)  That it carries a preferential right to ‹;1’   end to be paid either as a

fixed amount payable to p calculated by a fixed rate
areholders or an amount
e    a1 value of each share before
any dividend is paid to     u    areholders.
That with respect to   iJ'a1 itJYfries or will carry, on the winding up of the company, the Derek 
right to the repayment of capital before anything is paid to equi   areholders.
However, notwithstandi    e above two conditions, a holder of the preference share may have list to 
participate fully or to a limited extent in the surpluses of the come asspecified in the Memorandum 
or Articles of the company. Thus, the preference shares can be participating and non- 
participating. Similarly, these shares can be cumulative or non-cumulative, and redeemable or 
irredeemable.
J.4.z Equity Shares
According to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 2013, an equity share is a share which is not a 
preference share. In other words, shares which do not enjoy any preferential right in the payment 
of dividend or repayment of capital, are termed as equity/ordinary shares. The equity shareholders 
are entitled to share the distributable profits of the company after satisfying the dividend rights 
of the preference share holders. The dividend on equity shares is not fixed and it may vary from 
year to year depending upon the amount of profits available

for distribution. The equity share capital may be (i) with voting rights; or (ii) with differential 
rights as to voting, dividend or otherwise in accordance with such rules and subject to such 
conditions as may be prescribed in the Articles of Association of the company.

(h) Capital reserves are created from capital profits.
(i) At the time of issue of shares, the maximum rate of securities

(j) The part of capital which is called up only on windi  up is called reserve capital.


1.5  Issue of Sbazes

A salient characteristic of the   pit     a company is that the amount on its shares can be 
gradually collected   easy instalments spread over a period of time depending upon its growi    
nancial requirement. The first instalment is collected along with applica   f1•arid is thus, known 
as application money, the second on allotment (terme    allotment money), and the remaining 
instalments are termed as first call, send call and so on. The word final is sufficed to the last 
instalment.  However,  this in no way which prevents a company from calling the full amount on 
shares right at the time of application.
The important steps in the procedure of share issue are
•  Issue of Prospectus: The company first issues the prospectus to the public. Prospectus is an 
invitation to the public that a new company has come into existence and it needs funds for doing 
business. It contains complete information about the company and the manner in which the money is 
to be collected from the prospective investors.
•  Receipt of Applications: When prospectus is issued to the public, prospective investors 
intending to subscribe the share capital of the company would make an application along with the 
application money





2021-22


8           Accoiiritnricp: Company Accounts met Annlpsis o/Financint Statements
and  deposit the same with a scheduled bank as specified in the prospectus. The company has to get 
minimum subscription within 120 days from the date of the issue of the prospectus. If the company 
fails to receive the same within the said period, the company cannot proceed for the allotment of 
shares and application money should be returned within 130 days of the date of issue of prospectus.
•  Allotment o/ Shnres: If minimum subscription has been received, the company may proceed for the 
allotment of shares after fulfilling certain other legal formalities. Letters of allotment are sent 
to those whom the shares have been alloted, and letters of regret to those to whom no allotment has 
been made. When allotment is made, it results in a valid contract between the company and the 
applicants who now became the shareholders of the company.


Minimum Subscription

It is to be noted that ‘m‘   um subscription’ of capital cannot be less than 90% of the issued 
amount   wording to SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 [6.3.8. 1 and 
6.3.8.2]. If this condition is not satisfied, the company shall forthwith refund the entire 
subscription amount received. If a delay occurs beyond 8 days from the date of closure of 
subscription list, the company shall be liable to pay the amount with interest at the rate of 15% 
[Section 73(2)].


Shares of a company are issued either at par or at a premium. Shares are to be issued at par when 
their issue price is exactly equal to their nominal value according to the terms and conditions of 
issue. When the shares of a company are issued more than its nominal value (face value), the excess 
amount is called premium.

Irrespective of the fact that shares are issued at par or at a premium, the share capital of a 
company as stated earlier, may be collected in instalments payable at different stages.
1.6  Accounting treatment
On application : The amount of money paid with various instalment represents the contribution to 
share capital and should ultimately be credited to share capital. However, for the sake of 
convenience, initially individual accounts are opened for each instalment. All money received along 
with application is deposited with a scheduled bank in a separate account opened for the purpose.

It is customary to ask f Anne amount called “Allotment Money" from the allottees on the share    
tted to them as soon as the allotment is made.
With the acceptan   o the offer made by the applicants, the amount of application money received 
has to be transferred to share capital account as it has formally become the part of the same.
The money received on rejected applications should be fully returned to the applicant within period 
prescribed by law/SEBI.
In case lesser number of shares have to be allotted, than those applied for the excess application 
money must be adjusted towards the amount due on allotment from the allottees.
•  The effect of the later two steps is to close the share application account which is only a 
temporary account for share capital transactions.

Sometimes n combined account for share application and share allotment called ‘Share Application

reasoning that allotment without  application is impossible while application  without allotment is 
meaningless. These two stages of share capital are closely inter-related. When a combined account 
is maintained, journal entries are recorded in the following manner:

Initial Public Offers and Rights Iss  be.   of securities (Shares, Debentures or Other Financial 
Instruments) may be s    ribed by paying Application Money by a banking instrument (Cheque, Pay 
orde   Draft, Debit to Bank Account or through Applications Supported Blocked Amou     BA). ASBA is 
one of the methods for payment of Application Money.
ASBA is a process developed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)to apply for 
subscribing to IPOs and Rights Issue etc. of securities. Under the method, the applicant authorises 
the bank to block the bank account for the application money, for subscribing the issue. The Bank 
debits the applicant's account with application money only if he / she is allotted securities 
(Shares / Debentures etc.) for the amount payable on allotted securities. In case, securities are 
not allotted, the bank removes the block (lien) on the amount.
Under ASBA based applications, Application Amount payable on the securities applied is blocked by 
the bank i.e., it marks a lien on amount payable as Application Money on Securities applied. After 
the company has allotted securities, bank debits the applicant's bank account by the amount payable 
on allotted securities and remove the lien on the balance amount.

On Caths : Calls play a vital role in making shares fully paid-up and for realising the full amount 
of shares from the shareholders. In the event of shares not being fully called up till the 
completion of allotment, the directors have the authority to ask for the remaining amount on shares 
as and when they decide about the same. It is also possible that the timing of the payment of calls 
by the shareholders is determined at the time of share issue itself and given in the prospectus.
Two points are important regarding the calls on shares. First, the amount on any call should not 
exceed 25% of the face value of shares. Second, there must be an interval of at least one month 
between the making of two calls unless otherwise provided by the articles of association of the 
company.
When a call is made and the amount of the same is received, the journal entries are as given below:

ust be added between the words
“Share” and ‘Call’ in the Shar   11 a  o nt depending upon the identity of the call made. for 
example, in case of    call it will be termed as ‘Share First Call Account’, in case of second call 
i    be ‘Share Second Call Account’ and so on. Another point to be noted is t     e words ‘and 
Final’ will also be added to the
last call, say, if second call    e last call it will be termed as ‘Second and Final
Call’ and if it is the third   whi ch is the last call, it will be termed as third and
Final Call’. It is also possible that the whole balance after allotment may be collected in one 
call only. In that case the first call itself, shall be termed as the ‘First and Final Call’.
The following points should be kept in mind while issuing the share capital for public subscription 
:
1.  The application money should be at least 5% of the face value of the share.
2.  Calls are to be made as per the provisions of the articles of association.
3.  Where there is no articles of association of its own, the following provisions of Table A will 
apply:
(a)  A period of one month must elapse between two calls;
(b)  The amount of call should not exceed 25% of the face value of the share;

(c)  A minimum of 14 days' notice is given to the shareholders to pay the amount; and
(d)  Calls must be made on a uniform basis on all shares within the same class.
4.  The procedure for accounting for the issue of both equity and preference shares is the same. To 
differentiate between the two the words ‘Equity’ and ‘Preference’ is prefixed to each and every 
instalment.

Sometimes shareholders pay a part or the whole of the amount of the calls not yet made. The amount 
so received from the shareholders is known as “Calls in Advance”. The amount received in advance is 
a liability of the company and should be credited to ‘Call in Advance Account.” The amount received 
will be adjusted towards the payment of calls as and when they becomes due. Table F of the 
Companies Act provides for the payment of interest on calls in advance at a rate not exceeding 12% 
per annum.

1. 6. H Otter subscription
There are instances when applications for more shares of a company are received than the number 
offered to the public for subscription. This usually happens in respect of shares issue of 
well-managed and financially strong companies and is said to be a case of‘Over Subscription’.
In such a condition, three alternatives are available to the directors to deal with the situation: 
(1) they can accept some applications in full and totally reject the others; (2) they can make a 
pro-rata allotment to all; and (3) they can adopt a combination of the above two alternatives which 
happens to be the most common course adopted in practice.
The problem of over subscription is resolved with the allotment of shares. Therefore, from the 
accounting point of view, it is better to place the situation of over subscription within the total 
frame of application and allotment, i.e. receipt of application amount, amount due on allotment and 
its receipt from the shareholders, and the same has been observed in the pattern of entries.
First Alternntiue : When the directors decide to fully  opt  some applications and totally reject 
the others, the application       received on rejected applications is fully refunded. For exam   a 
c     ny invited applications for 20,000 shares and received the applied     5,000 shares. The 
directors

rejected the applications for 5,000  As number and refunded their appli
are in excess of the required in full. In this case, the journal
entries on application and allo  e t   We as follows
The journal entries on appli       allotment according to this alternative are as follows:

Seconci Alternntiue : When the directors opt to make a proportionate allotment to all applicants 
(called ‘pro-rata’ allotment), the excess application money received is normally adjusted towards 
the amount due on allotment. In case, the excess application money received is more than the amount 
due on allotment of shares, such excess amount may either be refunded or credited to calls in 
advance.
For example, in the event of applications for 20,000 shares being invited and those received are 
for 25,000 shares, it is decieded to allot shares in the ratio of 4:5 to all applicants. It is a 
case of pro-rata allotment and the excess application money received on 5,000 shares would be 
adjusted towards the amount due on the allotment of 20,000 shares. In this case, the journal 
entries on application and allotment will be as follows.

(Allotment money received after adjusting the amount already received as excess application money)

Third Atternntiue : When the application for some shares are rejected outrightly; and pro-rata 
allotment is made to the remaining applicants, the money on rejected applications is refunded and 
the excess application money received from applicants to whom pro-rata allotment has been made is 
adjusted towards the amount due on the allotment of shares allotted.
For example, a company invited applications for 10,000 shares and received applications for 15,000 
shares. The directors decided to reject the applications for 2,500 shares outright and to make a 
pro-rata allotment of 10,000 shares to the applicants for the remaining 12,500 shares so that four 
shares are allotted

26           Accoiiritnricp: Company Accounts met Annlpsis o/Financint Statements

for every five shares applied. In this case, the money on applications for 2,500 shares rejected 
would be refunded fully and that on the remaining 2,500 shares (12,500 shares — 10,000 shares) 
would be adjusted against the allotment amount due on 10,000 shares allotted and credited to share 
allotment account, the journal entries on application and allotment recorded as follows:

1.0.H Msue o,f Shares at a Premium
It is quite common for the shares of financially strong and well-managed companies to be issued at 
a premium, i.e. at an amount more than the nominal or par value of shares. Thus, when a share of 
the nominal value of Rs. 100 is issued at Rs. 105, it is said to have been issued at a premium of 5 
per cent.
When the issue of shares is at a premium, the amount of premium may technically be called at any 
stage of the issue of shares. However, premium is generally called with the amount due on 
allotment, sometimes with the application money and rarely with the call money. The premium amount 
is credited to a separate account called ‘Securities Premium Account’ and is

1.6.6 Issuea  Shares at a Dfscourtt
There are instances when the shares of a company are issued at a discount, i.e. at an amount less 
than the nominal or par value of shares, the difference between the nominal value and issue price 
representing discount on the issue of shares. For example, when a share of the nominal value of Rs. 
100 is issued at Rs. 98, it is said to have been issued at a discount of two per cent.
As a general rule, a company carinot ordinarily issue shares at a discount. It can do so only in 
cases such as ‘reissue of forfeited shares’ (to be discussed later) and issue of sweat equity 
shares.

There are instances where a company enters into an arrangement with the vendors from whom it has 
purchased assets, whereby the latter agrees to accept, the payment in the form of fully paid shares 
of the company issued to them. Normally, no such cash is received for issue of shares. These shares 
can also be issued either at par, at premium or at discount, and th   umber of shares to be
issued will depend upon the price at which the shar     issued and the amount
payable to the vendor. The number of sees to.   sued to the vendor will be calculated as follows:

Number of shares to be issue

The important point to be n     n hi context is that the securities premium
account is not to be debite    the time of forfeiture if the premium has been received in respect 
of the    feited shares and the amount of forfeiture shall be excluding premium amount.
In case, however, if the premium amount has not been received, either wholly or partially, in 
respect of the shares forfeited, the Securities Premium Reserve Account will also be debited with 
the amount of premium not received along with the Share Capital Account at the time forfeiture. 
This will usually be the case when even the amount due on allotment has not been received. Thus, 
the journal entry to record the forfeiture of shares issued at a premium on which premium has not 
been fully received, will be :

J.'Z.I ReNsue of forfeited saores
The directors can either cancel or re-issue the fore     shares. In most cases, they reissue such 
shares which may bed  par,  premium or at a discount. Forfeited shares may be reissued as f     fii 
    par, premium, discount. In this context, it may be noted that the    un    iscount allowed 
cannot exceed the amount that had been receive     rfe’   shares at the time of initial issue,

Account relating to reissued Sha   should be treated as capital profit and
transferred to Capital Reserve count. For example, when a company forfeits

200 shares of Rs. 10 each maximum discount of Rs.
Rs. 600 had been received, it can allow a
on their reissue. Assuming that the company
reissues these shares for. 1,800 as fully paid, the necessary journal entry will be:

(Reissue of 200 forfeited shares at Rs. 9 per share as fully paid)
This shall leave a balance of Rs. 400 in share forfeited account which should be transferred to

Another important point to be noted in this context is that the capital profit arises only in 
respect of the forefited share reissued, and not on all forefeited shares. Hence, when a part of 
the forfeited shares are reissued, the whole balance of share forfeiture account cannot be 
transferred to the capital reserve. In such a situation, it is only the proportionate amount of 
balance that relates to the forefeited shares reissued which should be transferred to capital 
reserve, ensuring that the remaining balance in share forefeiture account is proportionate to the 
amount forefeited on shares not yet reissued.

Share: Fractional part of the capital,   d f     he basis of ownership in a company. Shares are 
generally of two Us,     . *equity shares and preference shares, according to the provisions of the 
    anies Act, 2013. Preference shares again are of different types based on vat   g shades of 
rights attached to them.
Share Capital of a comp  y   collected by issuing shares to either a select group of persons 
through t  N•oute of private placements and/or offered to the public for subscription.    s, the 
issue of shares is basic to the capital of a company. Shares are issued either for cash or for 
consideration other than cash, the former being more common. Shares are said to be issued for 
consideration other than cash when a company purchases business, or some asset/assets, and the 
vendors have agreed to receive payment in the form of fully paid shares of a company.
Stages o/ Share Issue: The issue of shares for cash is required to be made in strict conformity 
with the procedure laid down by law for the same. When shares are issued for cash, the amount on 
them can be collected at one or more of the following stages:
(i)  Application for shares
(ii)  Allotment of shares
(iii)  Call/Calls on shares.

Caths in Arrears: Sometimes, the full amount called on allotment and/or call (calls) is not 
received from the allottees/shareholders. The amount not so received are cumulatively called 
‘Unpaid calls’ or ‘Calls in Arrears’. However, it is not mandatory for a company to maintain a 
separate Calls-in-Arrears Account. There are also instances where some shareholders consider it 
discreet to pay a part or whole of the amount not yet called-up on the shares allotted to them. Any 
amount paid by a shareholder in the excess of the amount due from him on allotment/call (calls) is 
known as ‘Calls in Advance’ for which a separate account is maintained. A company has the power to 
charge interest on calls in arrears and is under an obligation to pay interest on calls-in-advance 
if it accepts them in accordance with the provisions of Articles of Association.
Over Subscription: It is possible for the shares of some companies to be over subscribed which 
means that applications for more shares are received than the number offered for subscription.
If the amount of minimum subscription is not received to the extent of 90%, the issue dissolves. In 
case the applications received are less than the number of shares offered to the public, the issue 
is termed as ‘und   subscribed’.
Issue o/ Shares nt Premium: Irrespective of the fact th    ares have been issued for consideration 
other than cash, they can  e issu    her at par or at premium. The issue of shares at par implies 
that thy   re    e been issued for an amount exactly equal to their face or nominal va1  in  c     
ares are issued at a premium,
i.e. at an amount more than the n  i   o   r value of shares, the amount of premium is credited to 
a separat   co    alled ‘Securities Premium Reserve Account’, the use of which is s   1y regs ed by 
law.
Issue o Shares at Discount: Shar s     s well be issued at a discount, i.e. for an amount less than 
the nominal org   value of shares provided the company fully complies with the provisions laity+fvn 
by law with regard to the same. Apart from such compliance, shares of a   mpany cannot ordinarily 
be issued at a discount. According to the Compani    t, 2013, only sweat equity shares can be 
issued at a discount. When shares arBlssued at a discount, the amount of discount is debited to 
‘Discount on Issue of Share Account’, which is in the nature of capital loss for the company.
forfeiture o/ Shares: Sometimes, shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments on shares 
allotted to them. In such a case, the company has the authority to forfeit shares of the 
defaulters. This is called ‘Forfeiture of Shares’. Forfeiture means the cancellation of allotment 
due to breach of contract and to treat the amount already received on such shares as forfeited to 
the company. The precise accounting treatment of share forfeiture depends upon the conditions on 
which the shares have been issued — at par, premium or discount. Generally speaking, accounting 
treatment on forfeiture is to reverse the entries passed till the stage of forfeiture, the amount 
already received on the shares being credited to Forfeiture Shares Account.

Reissue o/ Shnres: The management of a company is vested with the power to reissue the shares once 
forfeited by it, subject of course, to the terms and conditions in the articles of association 
relating to the same. The shares can be reissued even at a discount provided the amount of discount 
allowed does not exceed the credit balance of Share forfeiture account relating to shares being 
reissued. Therefore, discount allowed on the reissue of forfeited shares is debited to Share 
forfeiture account.
Once all the forfeited shares have been reissued, any credit balance on Share forfeiture account is 
transferred to Capital Reserve representing profit on forfeiture of shares. In the event of all 
forfeited share not being reissued, the credit amount on Share forfeiture account relating to 
shares yet to be reissued is carried forward and the remaining balance on the account only is 
credited to capital reserve account.
