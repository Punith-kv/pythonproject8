If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b under the relation R and we write as

connection or link between a and b. As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of
relations.
In this chapter, we will study different types of relations and functions, composition
of functions, invertible functions and binary operations.

1.2  Types of Relations
In this section, we would like to study different types of relations. We know that a
relation in a set A is a subset of A × A. Thus, the empty set φ and A × A are two
extreme relations. For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} given by
R = {(a, b): a - b = 10}. This is the empty set, as no pair (a, b) satisfies the condition
a - b = 10. Si                                                                                    A, as all pairs
(a, b) in A ×                                                                                     ead us to the

Definition 4 A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence relation if R is
reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Example 2 Let T be the set of all triangles in a plane with R a relation in T given by
R = {(T1, T2) : T1 is congruent to T2}. Show that R is an equivalence relation.

is an equivalence relation.
Solution R is reflexive, as 2 divides (a - a) for all a ∈ Z. Further, if (a, b) ∈ R, then
2 divides a - b. Therefore, 2 divides b - a. Hence, (b, a) ∈ R, which shows that R is
symmetric. Similarly, if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then a - b and b - c are divisible by
2. Now, a - c = (a - b) + (b - c) is even (Why?). So, (a - c) is divisible by 2. This
shows that R is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation in Z.

In Example 5, note that all even integers are related to zero, as (0, ± 2), (0, ± 4)
etc., lie in R and no odd integer is related to 0, as (0, ± 1), (0, ± 3) etc., do not lie in R.
Similarly, all odd integers are related to one and no even integer is related to one.
Therefore, the set E of all even integers and the set O of all odd integers are subsets of
Z satisfying following conditions:
(i)  All ele                                                                                                        are related to

relation. Further, show that all the elements of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each

Solution Given any element a in A, both a and a must be either odd or even, so
that (a, a) ∈ R. Further, (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ both a and b must be either odd or even
⇒ (b, a) ∈ R. Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ all elements a, b, c, must be
either even or odd simultaneously ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R. Hence, R is an equivalence relation.
Further, all the elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each other, as all the elements
of this subset                                                                             are related to

Example 8 Show that the function f : N → N, given by f(x) = 2x, is one-one but not

Solution The function f is one-one, for f (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ 2x1 = 2x2 ⇒ x1 = x2. Further,
f is not onto, as for 1 ∈ N, there does not exist any x in N such that f(x) = 2x = 1.

Solution  Suppose f (x1) = f (x2). Note that if x1 is odd and x2 is even, then we will have
x1 + 1 = x2 - 1, i.e., x2 - x1 = 2 which is impossible. Similarly, the possibility of x1 being
even and x2 being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore,
both x1 and x2 must be either odd or even. Suppose both x1 and x2 are odd. Then
f (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ x1 + 1 = x2 + 1 ⇒ x1 = x2. Similarly, if both x1 and x2 are even, then also
f (x1) = f (x2)                                                                                  y odd number

1.4  Composition of Functions and Invertible Function
In this section, we will study composition of functions and the inverse of a bijective
function. Consider the set A of all students, who appeared in Class X of  a Board
Examination in 2006. Each student appearing in the Board Examination is assigned a
roll number by the Board which is written by the students in the answer script at the
time of exami                                                                                 s to deface the

roll number. L                                                                                set of all code

Example 16 Find gof and fog, if f : R → R and g : R → R are given by f (x) = cos x
and g (x) = 3x2. Show that gof  ≠ fog.
Solution We have gof (x) =  g (f (x)) = g (cos x) = 3 (cos x)2 = 3 cos2 x. Similarly,
fog (x) =  f (g (x)) =  f (3x2) = cos (3x2). Note that 3cos2 x ≠ cos 3x2, for x = 0. Hence,
gof ≠ fog.

easy to verify that the composite gof = IX is the identity function on X and the composite
fog = IY is the identity function on Y.
Remark  The interesting fact is that the result mentioned in the above example is true
for an arbitrary one-one and onto function f : X → Y. Not only this, even the converse
is also true , i.e., if f : X → Y is a function such that there exists a function g : Y → X
such that gof = IX and fog = IY, then f must be one-one and onto.
The above discussion, Example 22 and Remark lead to the following definition:

Definition 9 A function f : X → Y is defined to be invertible, if there exists a function
g : Y → X such that  gof = IX and fog = IY. The function g is called the inverse of f  and
is denoted by f-1.
Thus, if f is invertible, then f must be one-one and onto and conversely, if f is
one-one and onto, then f must be invertible. This fact significantly helps for proving a

and division are examples of binary operation, as ‘binary’ means two. If we want to
have a general definition which can cover all these four operations, then the set of
numbers is to be replaced by an arbitrary set X and then general binary operation is
nothing but association of any pair of elements a, b from X to another element of X.
This gives rise to a general definition as follows:

A ∪ B  in P, ∪ is binary operation on P. Similarly, the intersection operation ∩ carries

One may note that 3 and 4 can be added in any order and the result is same, i.e.,
3 + 4 = 4 + 3, but subtraction of 3 and 4 in different order give different results, i.e.,
3 - 4 ≠ 4 - 3. Similarly, in case of multiplication of 3 and 4, order is immaterial, but
division of 3 and 4 in different order give different results. Thus, addition and
multiplication of 3 and 4 are meaningful, but subtraction and division of 3 and 4 are
meaningless. For subtraction and division we have to write ‘subtract 3 from 4’, ‘subtract
4 from 3’, ‘divide 3 by 4’ or ‘divide 4 by 3’.

Remark Associative property of a binary operation is very important in the sense that
with this property of a binary operation, we can write a1 ∗ a2 ∗ ... ∗ an which is not
ambiguous. But in absence of this property, the expression a1 ∗ a2 ∗ ... ∗ an is ambiguous
unless brackets are used. Recall that in the earlier classes brackets were used whenever
subtraction or division operations or more than one operation occurred.

For the binary operation ‘+’ on R, the interesting feature of the number zero is that
a + 0 = a = 0 + a, i.e., any number remains unaltered by adding zero. But in case of
multiplication, the number 1 plays this role, as a × 1 = a = 1 × a, ∀  a in R. This leads

Solution Note that the characteristic of sets {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8} and {3, 6, 9} is
that difference between any two elements of these sets is a multiple of 3. Therefore,

Example 46 Find the number of all one-one functions from set A = {1, 2, 3} to itself.
Solution One-one function from {1, 2, 3} to itself is simply a permutation on three
symbols 1, 2, 3. Therefore, total number of one-one maps from {1, 2, 3} to itself is
same as total number of permutations on three symbols 1, 2, 3 which is 3! = 6.

Example 50 Consider the identity function IN : N → N defined as IN (x) = x ∀ x ∈ N.
Show that although IN is onto but IN + IN : N → N defined as
(IN + IN) (x) = IN (x) + IN (x) = x + x = 2x is not onto.
Solution Clearly IN is onto. But IN + IN is not onto, as we can find an element 3
in the co-domain N such that there does not exist any x in the domain N with
(IN + IN) (x) = 2x = 3.

(1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used till the set
theoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was
developed by Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The set theoretic definition of function
known to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet
in a rigorous manner.
