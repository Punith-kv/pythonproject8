Hmm! One Piece Here Can Be Regarded As A Homonym, Which Is The Name Of The Anime Series And The Hidden Treasure Which Has All Pirates In This Anime Mad About.

One Piece ( The Series) Is About A Young Resilient, Deligent , United And Determined Crew Of Pirates With A Captain Whose Ambition Is To Become The Pirate King (Notably, The King Of All Pirates And The Most Powerful Pirate). Each Crew Member Has His Or Her Own Story And Adventure. Basically, This Anime Is Indefinable.

This One Piece ( The Treasure) When Found, Makes The Founder The Pirate King . This Is The Greatest Treasure Hidden By The Late Pirate King, Gold D. Roger. It Is Believed By Some People That There Is No One Piece But, A Formidable Character, Whitebeard, A Comrade Of Gold D. Roger Assures Us That, One Piece Is Real Before He Passes Away In Battle.

It Is A Great Anime, Once You Are Hooked, It Is Forever.
